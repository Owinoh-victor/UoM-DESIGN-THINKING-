this program uses a simple loop and if structres to navigate a menu
that calculates a total before and after taxes(.06) are applied



##varibles

choice = int()
price = float()
total = float()
tax = float()


##IF STRUCTURE


while choice != 7:
    
choice = ("please select an item: ")
price = 0

  if (choice == 1):
     price = 9.99
        
  elif (choice == 2):
     price = 5.99
        
  elif (choice == 3):
     price = 12.99
        
  elif (choice == 4):
     price = 11.99
        
  elif (choice == 5):
     price = 8.99
        
  elif (choice == 6):
     price = 5.99
        
  elif (choice > 7) or (choice < 0):
     print("OPTION NOT FOUND")

    total = total + price


tax = total *.06
total = total + tax


print("your tax total was ",tax)
print("TOTAL COST: ",total)
