Develop a program to help us determine the cost when we overdraw our account.  The user will enter in their balance and the amount of the check.  If the check is bigger than the balance the account is considered overdrawn.  If the overdrawn amount is greater than $25 the fee is $10.  If the overdrawn amount is greater than $50 the fee is $25.  If the overdrawn amount is greater than $100 the fee is $40.

Pseudocode

1.  Ask the user for the amount of the check and the balance
	prompt "Enter in your balance:  "
	input balance
	prompt "Enter the amount of your check:  "
	input check

	OR
	
	prompt user for the balance and the amount of the check
	input check and balance	


2. Determine if there is a fee and if there is a fee the amount
	if check > balance then
		
		overdrawn = check - balance
		
		if overdrawn >= 100 then
			fee = 40
		else if overdrawn >= 50 then
			fee = 25
		else if overdrawn >= 25 then
			fee = 10
		else
			fee = 5
		end if
		
		print("Sorry you have an overdraft fee of:  $" + fee)

	else
		fee = 0
		print("You did not overdraw your account")
	end if
