Create a program that will allow us to keep track of how much snow we have on the ground.  
The program will ask the user for the month and then how much snow has fallen.  It will
also ask the user for how much snow has melted.  The program will calculate the amount of
snow still on the ground, how much snow has fallen in total and how much snow has melted 
in total.  The program will end when the user is done entering snow values.

inputs:  snow that has fallen, month, snow melted, User Answer
outputs:  Total snow on the ground, Total snow melted, Total snow fall

	#Ask user for month, melted and fallen
	

	#Calculate total melted, fallen and amount on the ground
	TotalMelted = TotalMelted + melted

	#Ask user if they wish to continue
	write "Do you wish to add another month?"
