Write a program that allows the user to calculate how much time they need to spend on homework in a week.  The user will be asked how many classes they have and the number of credit hours per class.  The program will tell the user the number of hours they need to spend doing homework and the total number of credit hours they are taking this term.  Estimate 2 hours per credit hour for homework.

inputs:  Number of classes, Number of credit hours per class

outputs:  Time spend doing homework, Total number of credit hours

Variables:
***************************
NumClasses	integer
CreditHours	integer
Count		integer
TimeSpent	float
TotalCredits	integer
Hours		float  set to 2  (constant)

Determine the time spent doing homework
Output Time spent and total credit hours

Pseudocode
****************************
1.  Ask user how many classes they are taking
	write "Enter the number of classes you are taking:  "
	input NumClasses

2.  Determine the time spent doing homework
	Until count >= NumClasses
		Write "How many credit hours is this class:  "
		input CreditHours
		count = count + 1
		TotalCredits = TotalCredits + CreditHours
	End Loop
	TimeSpent = Hours * TotalCredits

3.  Output Time spent and total credit hours
	Write "You are taking a total of " + TotalCredits + " hours"
	Write "Plan on spending " + TimeSpent + " doing Homework this term :("
