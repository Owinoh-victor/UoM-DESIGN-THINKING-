Problem Statement: The program that will ask the user for the amount of yearly income they receive. Then, it 
will calculate the income tax. Finally, the program will output the income after tax and the total tax in dollars

* Create a class and determine/define the income after tax
* Detemine and define the tax based on income
* Detemine and define tax total
* Detemine and define then net pay
* Return all of income, tax, and nepay
* Define the main, input to ask the user for income, call (Tax, TaxTotal, NetPay), output the 
  income after tax and tax in dollars



Pseudocode:
***********
* Make a class and determine/define the income after tax
	. Create the IncomeCalcualtion class then
	. define in it within self and NewIncome then (For creating and defining the constructore)
	. Set self.__income = NewIncome
        	. Set self.__rate = (Float)
        	. Set self.__tax = (Float)
       	. Set self.__netpay = (Float)
	
* Detemine and define the tax based on income
	. Define DetermineTax within self then
	. use an if structore to determine based tax for (income <= 20000 then rate = 0.0, income >= 20000 
	  and <100000 then rate = 0.25, income 100000 and 250000 then rate = 0.35, else then rate = 0.45) 

* Detemine and define tax total
	. Define DetermineTaxTotal within self then
	. self.__tax = self.__income * self.__rate (This for calculating the tax total)

* Detemine and define then net pay
	. Define DetermineNetPay within self then
	. self.__netpay = self.__income - self.__tax (This for calculating the net pay)

* Return all of income, tax, and nepay
	. Define GetIncome within self then
	. return self.__income (This for returning the income amount)
	. Define GetTax within self then
	. return self.__tax (This for returning the tax rate)
	. Define GetNetPay within self then
	. return self.__netpay (This for returning the net pay)

* Define the main, input to ask the user for income, call (Tax, TaxTotal, NetPay), output the 
  income after tax and tax in dollars
	. Set IncomeAmount = (Float)
	. IncomeAmount = float(input("Enter your income: $")) (This for getting the income amount from the user)
	. TaxCalc = IncomeCalculation(IncomeAmount) (This for creating an object based of the income calculation class)
	. TaxCalc.DetermineTax() (This for calling the tax rate)
    	. TaxCalc.DetermineTaxTotal() (This for calling the tax total)
    	. TaxCalc.DetermineNetPay() (This for calling the net pay)
	. Output the total income after tax and the total tax in dollars
