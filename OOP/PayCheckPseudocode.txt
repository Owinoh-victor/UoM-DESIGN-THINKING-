Get Hours worked and Pay Rate from the User
	Write “Enter the number of hours worked.”
	Input Hours
	Write “Enter the pay rate”
	Input Rate
Determine Net Pay
	Gross Pay = NewEmp.Gross
	Deductions = NewEmp.Deduct
	Net = NewEmp.Net
Output Gross Pay, Deductions and Net Pay
	Write “The employee’s Gross Pay is:  $” + Gross Pay
	Write “ The employee’s Deductions is:  $” + Deductions
