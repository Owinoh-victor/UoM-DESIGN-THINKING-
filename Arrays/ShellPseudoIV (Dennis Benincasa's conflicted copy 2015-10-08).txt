Problem:  Create a program that will allow kids on vacation to collect shells on a beach.  Each time this program is run the number of children collecting shells and the number of days they will collect shells will vary.  So at the beginning of the program you will need to ask the user how many days the children will be collecting shells.  The program will continue until the user is done entering in data for each child.  Assume that at the start of each day, each child is given a bag to store their shells.  The program will take these daily shells and add it to the groups shells.  The user wants to see a total number of shells for each user and their average number of shells.  At the end of the program  the user wants to see the total number of shells collected for the group and the average number of shells collected per child.

Inputs:  Number of days, Name of each child, number of shells collected each day
Outputs:  total number of shells for each child, the total number of shells and average for the group
