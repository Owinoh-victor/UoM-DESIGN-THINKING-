Pseudocode
*****************************************
1).  Ask how many labs
	prompt "Enter the number of labs:  ")
	input NumLabs

2).  Fill the scores array
	until index > NumLabs
		prompt "Enter a lab score:  ")
		input labscore
		scores[index] = labscore
		index = index + 1
	end loop

3).  Determine average
	index = 1
	until index > NumLabs
		onescore = scores[index]
		totalscores = totalscores + onescore
		index = index + 1
	end loop

	average = totalscores/NumLabs

4).  Output the average
	print ("Your average grade is:  "+ average)
