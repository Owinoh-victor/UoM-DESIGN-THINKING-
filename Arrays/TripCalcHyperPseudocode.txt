Create a program that will allow you to determine the cost to travel to and from a particular destination.  Within each destination there can be multiple stops.  The program will ask the user for the name of the destination and the number of stops.  It will also ask for the car's current miles per gallon and the cost of fuel.  For each stop it will ask the user for the number of miles between each stop.  It will then determine the number of gallons and the cost.

inputs:  destination, number of stops each way, mpg, fuel cost, miles between each stop
outputs:  total cost between each stop, total miles between each stop, total cost of the trip one way, total miles for the trip one way, total cost of the trip both ways and total miles of the trip both ways

Ask the user the destination, car mpg and fuel cost
Determine cost of the trip
Output total cost

Pseudocode
*****************************************
1.  Ask the user the destination, car mpg and fuel cost

	Validation for mpg

	while flag = False
		if mpg is a number then
			convert string to number
			if mpg > 0 then
				flag = true
			else
				Ask the user for another number
			end if
		else
			Ask the user for another number
		end if
	loop
	flag = False

	Validation for Fuel Cost

	while flag = False
		if Fuel Cost is a number then
			convert string to number
			if Fuel Cost > 0 then
				flag = true
			else
				Ask the user for another number
			end if
		else
			Ask the user for another number
		end if
	loop
	flag = False


2.  Determine cost of the trip
    while paths <=2
	Ask user for number of stops

	Validate stops to make sure it is a number

	while flag = False
		if stops is a number then
			convert string to number
			if stops > 0 then
				flag = true
			else
				Ask the user for another number
			end if
		else
			Ask the user for another number
		end if
	loop
	flag = False

	while stops <= NumStops
	    Ask user for number of miles
	    	
            Validation for miles
 
            while flag = False
		if miles is a number then
			convert string to number
			if miles > 0 then
				flag = true
			else
				Ask the user for another number
			end if
		else
			Ask the user for another number
		end if
	    loop
            flag = False

            gallons = NumMiles/mpg
	    stopCost = gallons * FuelCost
	    TotalOneWayGallons = TotalOneWayGallons + gallons
	    TotalOneWayCost = TotalOneWayCost + stopCost
	    stops = stops + 1
	    print gallons and FuelCost		
	end while
	Print TotalOneWayGallons
	Print TotalOneWayCost
	TotalTripGallons = TotalTripGallons + TotalOneWayGallons
	TotalTripCost = TotalTripCost + TotalOneWayCost
	TotalOneWayGallons = 0
	TotalOneWayCost = 0
	stops = 1
	paths = paths + 1
    end while
3.  Output TotalTripGallons and TotalTripCost
